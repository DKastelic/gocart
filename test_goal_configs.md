# Goal Manager Configuration Test Results

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Staggered Goal Generation**
- Controllers now start with 500ms delays between them
- Reduces simultaneous goal conflicts
- Creates more natural, wave-like goal patterns

### 2. **Smart Cooldown Logic**
- **Successful goals**: Normal 2-5 second intervals
- **Failed/abandoned goals**: 3-5 second cooldown + extended wait
- **Goal persistence**: Goals must exist for at least 4 seconds before replacement

### 3. **Adaptive Goal Generation**
- After recent failures, goals are biased toward center of cart ranges
- Reduces likelihood of border conflicts
- Still maintains interesting behavior

### 4. **Configurable Presets**

#### Default Configuration (Current)
```go
MinGoalInterval:    2 * time.Second
MaxGoalInterval:    5 * time.Second  
CooldownAfterFail:  3 * time.Second
MinGoalPersistence: 4 * time.Second
StaggerDelay:       500 * time.Millisecond
```

#### Reactive Configuration (Less Conflicts)
```go
MinGoalInterval:    3 * time.Second
MaxGoalInterval:    8 * time.Second
CooldownAfterFail:  5 * time.Second
MinGoalPersistence: 6 * time.Second
StaggerDelay:       1 * time.Second
```

#### Aggressive Configuration (More Dynamic)
```go
MinGoalInterval:    1 * time.Second
MaxGoalInterval:    3 * time.Second
CooldownAfterFail:  2 * time.Second
MinGoalPersistence: 2 * time.Second
StaggerDelay:       200 * time.Millisecond
```

## Usage

### To use reactive mode (fewer conflicts):
```
// In main.go or via web interface
goalManager.SetReactiveConfig()
```

### To use aggressive mode (more activity):
```
goalManager.SetAggressiveConfig()
```

### To customize:
```go
config := GoalManagerConfig{
    MinGoalInterval:    2 * time.Second,
    MaxGoalInterval:    4 * time.Second,
    CooldownAfterFail:  3 * time.Second,
    MinGoalPersistence: 3 * time.Second,
    StaggerDelay:       500 * time.Millisecond,
    // ... other fields
}
goalManager.SetConfig(config)
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Reduced Erratic Behavior**: Goals persist longer and aren't immediately cancelled
2. **Smart Recovery**: After failures, the system takes a step back before trying again
3. **Maintained Interest**: The simulation remains dynamic but more predictable
4. **Adaptive Behavior**: The system learns from recent failures and adjusts accordingly
5. **Configurable Trade-offs**: Easy to adjust between stability and dynamism
